# Scorer
A Simple Game Scoring App for iOS

## Project Goals
Quite simply, I just want to learn iOS development and my family likes to play 500 quite often, so it seems like a natural fit to move the computation of the scoring to an iOS app. It also helps that many people in my family currently have an iOS device so I'll be able to pass it around to them as well.

## Technologies
* iOS 7

## Roadmap
### Version 1
* full scoring of 500 game (correctly)

### Version 1.1
* historical record of past games scored
* ability to edit incorrect hands
* options for some "house rules"

### Version 2
* iCloud backup of scores and syncing with other iOS devices
* submission of completed games to web service for anonymous stats
